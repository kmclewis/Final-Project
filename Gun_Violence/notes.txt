Our data is nonlinear and is a time series.  

We researched types of machine learning that worked with time series forecasting.

We discovered a type of recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory.

Recurrent neural networks can be used when data is sequential.  Our dataset is number of gun violence victims from 01/01/14 through 12/31/17.  

The Long Short Term Memory model is very complex.  In short, it makes predictions using historic data.

We're running a stacked LSTM model, which means it has multiple hidden layers stacked one on top of another.  LSTM layers require three-dimensional input and return a two-dimensional 
output.  By setting the option "return_sequences=True", the layer will return a three-dimensional output which will feed into the next layer.  The model will eventually return a two-dimensional output.

Our data has been split 75/25 based on the date 12/31/16.

The training data is comprised of the years 2014 - 2016.  Our testing data is the year 2017.

We used this model to predict 2017 gun violence victims and then graphed the results comparing 2017 actual numbers vs the model's predicted values. 

The model has two LSTM layers and one Dense layer.  It runs for 14 epochs.  Loss is determined by 'mean squared error'.
